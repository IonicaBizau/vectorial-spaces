# Vectorial Spaces
Create animations for vector decomposition in intermediar bases.

## Online
You can [open and see the project online, hosted on GitHub pages](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/vectorial-spaces).

## Example

> *B<sub>1</sub> = { u<sub>1</sub> = (1, 1), u<sub>2</sub> = (0, 2)}*

> *B<sub>2</sub> = { e<sub>1</sub> = (1, 0), e<sub>2</sub> = (0, 1)}*

> *v = (3, 5)*

The point represented in the two bases is:

> *v = 3u<sub>1</sub> + 1u<sub>2</sub> = (3, 3) + (0, 2) = (3, 5)*

> *v = 3e<sub>1</sub> + 5e<sub>2</sub> = (3, 0) + (0, 5) = (3, 5)*
